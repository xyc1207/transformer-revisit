## A Revisit of _Transformer_

_Transformer_ has achieved state-of-the-art results on many natural language processing tasks. In this work, we revisit _Transformer_ from the following aspects:
- [An introduction of _Transformer_](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/analysis/transformer)
- [A study on IWSLT 2014 German-to-English](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/analysis/iwslt2014_deen)
- [A study on WMT 2014 English-to-French](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/analysis/wmt2014_enfr)
- [A study on WMT 2014 English-to-German](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/analysis/wmt2014_ende)

## NMT Baselines
We summarize the previous baselines on several benchmark datasets:
* [IWSLT2014 German-to-English](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/summary/baselines_iwslt2014_deen.html)
* [WMT 2014 English-to-French](https://xyc1207.github.io/transformer-revisit/summary/baselines_wmt14_enfr.html)
